# Introduction
This is the third course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, **Getting and Cleaning Data**. This course focuses on collecting and cleaning data for downstream analysis and sharing.

# Course Description
Before you can work with data you have to get some. This course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course will cover obtaining data from the web, from APIs, and from colleagues in various formats including raw text files, binary files, and databases. It will also cover the basics of data cleaning and how to make data tidy. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course will also cover the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data. The course will cover the basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.

### Week 1: Welcome
In this first week of the course, we look at finding data and reading different file types.

### Week 2: Data formats
The primary goal is to introduce you to the most common data storage systems and the appropriate tools to extract data from web or from databases like MySQL.

### Week 3: Managing data
This week the lectures will focus on organizing, merging and managing the data you have collected using the lectures from Weeks 1 and 2.

### Week 4: Text and date manipulation
This week we finish up with lectures on text and date manipulation in R. In this final week we will also focus on peer grading of Course Projects.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
